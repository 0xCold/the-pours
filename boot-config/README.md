Only thing you should have to replace is the `scope.types.values` to be the array of mints you want to handle.

There is a ref to my local directory in `itemImageFile` at the very end. But I dont think this is referenced anymore. 

If it is, then you can point it to your version of the `pours-traits/` dir. 

I've added 2,300 Mint IDs to your list
